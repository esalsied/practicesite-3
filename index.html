							<p> In this section I give brief overviews of my takeaways from each of the semesters I have taken or will soon take at George Mason University</p>

									<article class="item">
										<header>
											<h3>Fall 2019</h3>
										</header>
	<ul>
		<li> BIOL <strong>103</strong>- <em> Introductory Biology I (Lecture &amp Lab)</em> </li>
		<li> CHEM <strong>103</strong>- <em> Chemical Science in Modern Society I (Lecture &amp Lab)</em> </li>
		<li> MATH <strong>106</strong>- <em> Quantitative Reasoning</em> </li>
		<li> PSYC <strong>100</strong>- <em> Basic Concepts in Psychology</em> </li>
	</ul>
	<p class="one"> I was trying to take a lighter courseload for this semester but it still ended up being quite an adjustment especially in terms of class sizes as I had never been in a class with over thirty people before this point. None of the classes were particularly difficult but my procrastination habits got the best of me at times. </p>
									</article>
									<article class="item">
										<header>
											<h3>Spring 2020</h3>
										</header>
	<ul>
		<li> BIOL <strong>107</strong>- <em> Introduction to Biology II (Lab Only)</em> </li>
		<li> COMM <strong>101</strong>- <em> Fundamentals of Communication</em> </li>
		<li> ENGH <strong>101</strong>- <em> Composition</em> </li>
		<li> PHIL <strong>100</strong>- <em> Introduction to Philosophy</em> </li>
		<li> PSYC <strong>231</strong>- <em> Social Psychology</em> </li>
	</ul>
	<p> This was definitely my most diverse semester in terms of the classes I was taking. This diversity was helpful because it gave a broader context to my education which is generally a good thing. This was also the first semester to be affected by the <b> Coronavirus </b> which was a whole adjustment onto itself. </p>

											<h3>Fall 2020</h3>
										</header>
	<ul>
		<li> BIOL <strong>106</strong>- <em> General Biology II (Lab Only)</em> </li>
		<li> HNRS <strong>302</strong>- <em> Research and Inquiry Transfers</em> </li>
		<li> PSYC <strong>300</strong>- <em> Statistics in Psychology (Lecture &amp Lab)</em> </li>
		<li> PSYC <strong>301</strong>- <em> Research Methods in Psychology (Lecture &amp Lab)</em> </li>
		<li> PSYC <strong>317</strong>- <em> Cognitive Psychology</em> </li>
	</ul>
	<p> This was the last semester I took psychology classes and I ended up taking so many because I wanted to make a definitive choice as to whether or not I would further pursue psychology as a major. Despite doing well in all of these classes, I made the decision to change my major by the end of the semester. </p>

											<h3>Spring 2021</h3>
										</header>
	<ul>
		<li> ENGH <strong>301</strong>- <em> The Fields of English</em> </li>
		<li> ENGH <strong>305</strong>- <em> Dimensions of Writing and Literature</em> </li>
		<li> HNRS <strong>122</strong>- <em> 20th &amp 21st Century World Poetry</em> </li>
		<li> IT <strong>104</strong>- <em> Introduction to Computing</em> </li>
	</ul>
	<p> This was my first semester taking English classes and I definitely felt like I was getting more out of my classes. Doing well in these classes helped to increase the confidence I have in my own writing. </p>

												<h3>Summer 2021</h3>
											</header>
	<ul>
		<li> PHIL <strong>253</strong>- <em> Philosophy and Literature</em> </li>
		<li> ENGH <strong>375</strong>- <em> Web Authorship and Design</em> </li>
	</ul>
	<p> These are the first summer courses I have ever taken and I would be lying if I said adjusting was not a struggle. In the past I viewed the summer as a time away from academics designated for either a job or relaxation but these classes have really challenged that idea and probably for the better. </p>

												<h3>Fall 2021</h3>
											</header>
	<ul>
		<li> ENGH <strong>308</strong>- <em> Theory and Inquiry </em> </li>
		<li> ENGH <strong>352</strong>- <em> Haunted Native America </em> </li>
		<li> ENGH <strong>389</strong>- <em> Peer Tutoring Writing </em> </li>
		<li> ENGH <strong>396</strong>- <em> Introduction to Creative Writing </em> </li>
		<li> HNRT <strong>125</strong>- <em> Applied Quanititative Reasoning </em> </li>
	</ul>
	<p> I am excited for this semester because I am not entirely sure what it holds in store. This will be my first semester working at the Writing Center so scheduling my time will be a key element of succeeding in these courses. </p>

								<h2>Personal Narrative</h2>
							</header>
							<img src="writingimage.jpeg">

							<p>When I first came to George Mason, I wanted to pursue a career in the healthcare industry. More specifically, I was conflicted between becoming a <i>psychologist</i> and becoming a <i>physician</i>, leaning more towards becoming a <i>psychologist</i>. This is indicated both by the classes I took during my first three semesters at George Mason as well as my having worked as a <i>CNA</i> during my freshman year.</p> <p> During the Fall semester of my sophomore year, I realized that I no longer wanted to pursue psychology and chose to shift my focus towards English and writing in general. English and writing have always come more naturally to me than other disciplines so I figured that it would make sense to center my education around them. Although I still have some catching up to do within the major, I feel more satisfied majoring in English than I was majoring in psychology.</p> <p>Currently, I am pursuing a career as a <i>technical writer</i> although I am definitely open to exploring other career paths. Despite my past experience with coursework in the hard and social sciences, I would like to focus my technical writing career on technology-related fields like software, web design, etc. This was largely motivated by the flexibility that technology-related technical writing offers; something I value in a career. </p> <p>Another career path I have considered is becoming an <i>editor</i> mainly because, in the past, I have found that editing is something that generally comes naturally to me especially when it comes to reading writing in an essay format. While distinct from being an editor, I hope that being part of the Writing Center here at George Mason will give me a better sense of what I would like to do careerwise. </p>

								<h2>Work Experience</h2>
							</header>
							<img src="fnclogo.png">

							<p><h3> Fairfax Nursing &amp Rehabilitation Center </h3>
<ul>
	<li> Certified Nursing Assistant:<em> August 2019- August 2020 </em> </li>
	<li> <a href ="https://fairfaxhc.com/"> <b>Fairfax Nursing &amp Rehabilitation Center Website</b> </a> </li>
</ul>
<p class="one"> It was a challenge to balance coursework and the demands of this position during the semester but it was definitely worth my time. This position helped me realize the importance of pacing myself not only in the workplace but also throughout life in general. </p>
<aside>
<h5> *Certified Nursing Assistant
<p> Responsible for helping patients or residents with activities of daily living such as eating, ambulation, toileting, etc. </p> </h5>
</aside> 
</section>

<section>
<h3> Osbourn High School </h3>
<ul>
	<li> Writing Center Tutor:<em> August 2018- May 2019 </em>
	<li> <a href ="https://www.mcpsva.org/Page/2006"> <b>Eagle Writing Center Website</b> </a> </li>
</ul>
<p> This experience stands out when compared to my previous and subsequent positions which fall more into the realm of health care. This position taught me that patience is both an internal and external form of self discipline which I believe can be helpful in a plethora of situations. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h3> Novant Health UVA Prince William Medical Center </h3>
<ul>
	<li> Hospital Volunteer <em> Summer 2018 </em> </li>
	<li> <a href ="https://www.novanthealthuva.org/giving/volunteering/novant-health-auxiliary/summer-teen-program.aspx"> <b>Summer Teen Program Website</b> </a> </li>
</ul>
<p> This was the first form of work experience I ever had. The most important thing I took away from this position was that independence can be a useful learning tool when you run into an obstacle although this is not always the case. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h3> Current Work Experience </h3>
<ul>
	<li> Writing Center Tutor (George Mason University) <em> Starting Fall 2021 </em> </li>
</ul>
<p> This position seemed like the next logical step for someone who wants to further pursue writing as a career. While I have worked as a writing tutor before, I am sure that I will be learning quite a bit as part of the Writing Center. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h4> Potential Future Work Experience </h4>
<ul>
	<li> Internship (George Mason University) </li>
</ul>
<p> One of the classes one can take within the writing and rhetoric concentration is an internship which is definitely something I see myself taking advantage of in the future given I continue with this concentration. </p>
